# Rock vs Sonar Classification

## Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning model** that classifies objects as either **rock** or **sonar** using supervised learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing sonar signal readings to train a classifier that distinguishes between the two classes.

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of sonar readings reflected from rocks or mines.
- Each sample has **60 numerical features** representing different frequency components of the reflected signal.
- The target variable is binary: `Rock (R)` or `Mine (M)`.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models & evaluation)

## Project Structure
```
Rock_vs_Sonar.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook containing the model and analysis
README.md             # Project documentation
```

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset
   - Check for missing values
   - Normalize/scale features if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize feature distributions
   - Identify patterns in data using correlation heatmaps

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train/Test split of data
   - Implement classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluate performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**

4. **Predictions & Insights**
   - Test the model on new data
   - Analyze misclassified samples

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Navneet072300/ml_project-1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ml_project-1
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements file exists
   ```
4. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Run `Rock_vs_Sonar.ipynb` step by step.

## Results
- The model achieves **high accuracy** in classifying sonar signals.
- Feature importance analysis helps understand the key factors influencing classification.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with **deep learning models** (e.g., Neural Networks)
- Implement **hyperparameter tuning** for better performance
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time predictions
